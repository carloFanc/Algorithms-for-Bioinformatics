Implementation of the Smith-Waterman Algorithm

The modified version of the program must return all the possible local alignments (can be more than one) with the minimum number of gaps (can be 0) among the ones that have a length of at least 7. Gaps are included in the calculation of alignment length. Overlaps in trace-back paths are allowed.
